# Recommend-me-a-movie
Movie recommendation system based on user data. It helps the user to find new movies based on their preferences.

### Implementation

This application is being developed with **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** and **[Flask’s](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/)** Framework.

## Requisites
First, make sure you have installed Git and a Github account. To clone the repository execute:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adri-rh/Recommend-me-a-movie
```

Then, install the project’s dependencies written in requirements.txt. It is highly recommended to work with a virtual environment like virtualenv. See how it works [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After all, you should be able to run *Recommend me a movie*. Execute:

```bash
python app.py
```

If everything is working, you will get:
```
 * Serving Flask app 'app'
 * Debug mode: on
